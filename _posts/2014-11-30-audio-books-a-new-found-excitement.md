I have always wished I could find time to read more often than I do.  At night, a time where most can relax for a few moments and get lost in a book, I find my eyes are too tired from staring at a computer screen all day.

I have discovered audio books from Audible, an Amazon company ([http://www.audible.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141221120306/http://www.audible.com/ "http://www.audible.com/")).  What an amazing product!  The narrator not only makes the words more exciting, I feel it brings the story to life even more so than the internal narrator in my head when I am reading the paper copy.

Now when driving or working out, I find myself wanting to jump right back into my audio book.  If you have never auditioned an audio book before, I highly recommend it!  You will quickly see how convenient they are and how much more free time you will find to continue “reading”.

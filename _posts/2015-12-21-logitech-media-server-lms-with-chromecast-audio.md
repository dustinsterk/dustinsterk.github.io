I have recently started to look into the Google Chromecast Audio and the ability to use the device with LMS.  Luckily, a user over on the slimdevices forum has solved this problem.  Check out CastBridge as seen here: [ http://forums.slimdevices.com/showthread.php?104614-Announce-CastBridge-integrate-Chromecast-players-with-LMS-(squeeze2cast)](http://forums.slimdevices.com/showthread.php?104614-Announce-CastBridge-integrate-Chromecast-players-with-LMS-(squeeze2cast))

As of now, multiroom sync is not working (this is now supported within the CCA firmware), but the author [**philippe\_44**](http://forums.slimdevices.com/member.php?17261-philippe_44 "philippe_44 is offline")  is working on it.  I hope he makes this happen, as this would allow for a very cheap replacement of the squeezebox hardware.  You can purchase two Chromecast Audio's for $55 over at the main Google site: [ https://store.google.com/product/chromecast\_audio](https://store.google.com/product/chromecast_audio)

Happy Listening!

My first post in 4 year.  Hard to imagine, but COVID consumed 2 of the 4.

I have recently decided I have had enough with Wordpress and AWS Lightsail.  I have now moved to GitHub Pages + Jekyll!  Added a template [Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie), and migrated everything over using this script [Wordpress Export to Markdown](https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown).  So far I am pretty happy, and it is free to boot.

Happy Hosting!

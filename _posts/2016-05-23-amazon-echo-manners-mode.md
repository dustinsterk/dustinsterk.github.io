After having my Amazon Echo / Alexa for almost a full year now, I must say that I absolutely love it!  It is used every day in our home.  One feature that it is missing is a "manners mode".  I can envision this feature to work with a simple use case; you must say please at the end of every command that you ask the device.

This teaches both children and adults to more polite and respectful.  I also want to be in the good graces of these machines if the singularity ever comes to  fruition!  :)

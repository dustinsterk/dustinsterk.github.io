After a few years of trying to host this simple site with the provider [CloudAtCost](http://cloudatcost.com/), I have come to realize that their service is completely unstable and that they have ZERO customer service.  I have filed numerous tickets without a single answer and it has been well over two weeks.  I even tried to tweet them for a response....nothing.  Goodbye CloudAtCost, I hope you close your doors very soon.

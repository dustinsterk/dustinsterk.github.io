# Random Thoughts from the Past 9 Months
It has been a busy start to the new year with my full time role and family winter activities.  A few bits that have been keeping me busy:
* Travel - UK and Paris for work and pleasure.
* Dusting off my snowboard and teaching our family to ski (well, mainly my wife).
* VR golf and mini putt putt.
* Restoring DMG-01 Original Gameboy's.  Including building a "retro bright" lightbox to re-whitening yellowing plastic and some minor soldering work.
* Scanning local digital radio channels with my [Bluetail Technologies](https://bluetailtechnologies.com/){:target="_blank"} MicroP25RX.  Sadly this kit is no longer being produced but it is one great little device with a physical screen (via Wio Terminal) and [App based](https://github.com/tvelliott/MicroP25RXMon){:target="_blank"} scanning.  The sole owner of the company and engineer is possibly working on a updated model once chip supply chain issues ease.
* Hacking VR overlays for my favorite iRacing 3rd party app [RaceLabApp](https://racelab.app/){:target="_blank"}.
* Making my first batch of Sauerkraut in a [Fermentation Pot](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I8HT5IY){:target="_blank"}.
* Building a sim accessory VoCore 5" Dash with a [3D Printed Case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5429126){:target="_blank"} and [Screen](https://vocore.io/screen.html){:target="_blank"}
* Investigating CanBus [Data Collection](https://racechrono.com/forum/discussion/1746/my-first-build-can-bus-and-gps-through-bluetooth-le/p4){:target="_blank"} via a ESP32, Bluetooth and RaceChrono.  Example project [here](https://github.com/joeroback/racechrono-canbus){:target="_blank"} and [here](https://g80.bimmerpost.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1959139){:target="_blank"}.
* Home Air Quality monitoring via [Airgradient](https://www.airgradient.com/open-airgradient/kits/){:target="_blank"}.
* Getting back in shape with a Peloton and Garmin Forerunner 955 (I love this watch!).
* Nerding out on Sim racing data with [Garage61](https://garage61.net/){:target="_blank"}.
* Enjoying French Pressed Coffee.
* Enjoying:  The Last of Us, Clarkson's Farm (season 2), White Lotus, and others.
* Gearing up for a great season of IMSA and Indycar racing (and maybe a little track time myself this year).
